I'm sorry for being slow to add you as a collaborator, I've been sick and I haven't had much time to do anything! Since I didn't have the file, and I probably wont have time later, I pulled this file from a class mate's repo. I checked and it had not been changed since your commit, but if this is not what you want I can wait and turn it in after the soft deadline.
