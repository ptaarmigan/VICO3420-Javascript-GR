For this assignment, get the page to display all FIVE sales using the SALES array and a loop.

ALL MISTAKES/BUGS are in the JAVASCRIPT code only in week06.html.

There are five issues to fix. You might need to fix one part at a time to get errors in the console to point out the other errors. You can use references, the validator, or even AI tools to help you.

HINTS:

- Look at patterns in the code
- One mistake is directly related to last weeks' material
