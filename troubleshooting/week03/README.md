What is wrong visually that needs to be fixed:

1. The info for "Vivamus malesuada velit" and the two subheaders within should be in a blue column like the other two columns.
2. The footer should be centered.
3. The h1 header should be centered.
4. The font should be sans-serif.
5. The h3 headers should match (how is up to you)
