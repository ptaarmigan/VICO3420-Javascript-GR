For this assignment, get the form to display the info in an area below the form.

It should:
- Show the name only when text is in the name form.
- Font should update when the style and/or size is clicked/changed.
- The good day checkbox should be checked by default

ALL MISTAKES/BUGS are in the HTML Form code only in week07.html.

There are five issues to fix. You might need to fix one part at a time to get errors in the console to point out the other errors. You can use references, the validator, or even AI tools to help you.

HINTS:

- Look at patterns in the code
- Errors might not appear in the console, but are still errors when the form doesn't work as desired.
