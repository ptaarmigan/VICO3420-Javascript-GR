For this assignment, get the page to display the correct text based on age. 

At 18 and older, it should show the secret message. 

Under 18, but above zero years of age, it should say they are not old enough for the message. 

Anything that is below zero should call the user out for an impossible age.

If it is not a number, it should show text saying that the age could not be determined.

Please test these answers to make sure it's working:
- 18
- Number higher than 18
- Number between 0 and 17
- A negative number
- Text without a number
- Blank

Reminder: 
The FIRST else if that matches the condition in an if block will run.

There are five issues to fix. You might need to fix one to get errors in the console to point out the other errors. You can use references, the validator, or even AI tools to help you.
